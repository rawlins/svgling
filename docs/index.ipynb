    "The `svgling` package is a pure python package for rendering linguistics-style (constituent) trees in [SVG (Scalable Vector\n",
    "Graphics)](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/), a standardized vector format well-suited for web use. It accepts trees defined in terms of lists of lists (really, anything indexable) and strings, as well as `nltk.Tree` objects (or anything with the same API), and is fully integrated with rich display in Jupyter notebooks. This document gives a quick tour of how to use it and some main features; see the full manual for more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The package has three main design principles, which together make it relatively unique:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Be well suited for *programmatic* generation of tree diagrams via a high-level python api. This means that (a) many tweaks to tree layout are possible via compact and readable python code, and (b) the default settings with no customization should look decent to good on a very wide range of trees and tree styles across all browsers and SVG viewers.\n",
    "2. Be equally suited for theoretical linguistics and computational linguistics/NLP, at least for cases where the latter is targeting constituent trees. (This package is not aimed at dependency trees.)\n",
    "3. Do as much as possible with pure python (as opposed to python+javascript, or python+tk, or python+dot, or...).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `nltk` interface is described below; the list interface is pretty straightforward from bracketing notation. (In what follows, \"list\" is used a generic term that covers any indexable structure, including python lists and tuples.) The first element of the list is the label of a parent node, and any subsequent members of the list are daughter nodes. A parent node without a daughter node is a leaf node (as are non-list strings)."

    "## Installation and logistics\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the [release version](https://pypi.org/project/svgling/) from PyPI, use the `pip` command line tool: `pip install svgling`. On managed jupyter-based systems such as google colab, you can install by entering `!pip install svgling` into a notebook cell. The current unreleased version of `svgling` can also be installed from source via the github repository: [https://github.com/rawlins/svgling](https://github.com/rawlins/svgling). On a managed system, the simplest way to do this is to run `!pip install git+https://github.com/rawlins/svgling`. Please **report bugs** on that repository via [the issue tracker on github](https://github.com/rawlins/svgling/issues) if you encounter any!\n",
