    "This document is a detailed guide to using the `svgling` package; `svgling` is primarily a python tree-drawing package, aimed at linguists and computer scientists who want to draw constituent trees. It is tailored specifically towards rendering trees in Jupyter, but can be used for programmatically generating SVG and HTML tree diagrams in general -- one major external interface for doing this is via the [nltk package](https://www.nltk.org/). Beyond SVG constituent trees, `svgling` additionally supports a number of other diagram features useful to linguists, and it supports easy exporting to raster images."

    "## Background: SVG formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "Many options through this document interact with SVG formatting, via arguments pass to the `svgwrite` API. I won't specify the details of this here, see [the `svgwrite` docs](https://svgwrite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for details. Generally, `svgwrite` formatting parameters are validated and passed transparently through to svg itself with the python `_` character turned into `-`, so for details of how svgwrite parameters are interpreted, also see the SVG specification (and whatever viewer-specific documentation there is - not all SVG renderers are alike). I have generally not passed through all parameters, but rather chosen a few that I think are the most useful. Two key parameters that show up repeatedly for lines are `stroke` (which gets filled in with a color or `none`) and `stroke_width` (which gets filled in with a measurement, usually in user units for `svgling` trees).\n",

    "**Units**: SVG uses CSS-style units, which can be a little confusing. Here's a quick reference primer on the ones that will come up in this manual.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `user units`: the default internal unit of an SVG diagram. For svgling trees, at their default sizing, `1` is equivalent to `1px`. However, trees may be resized depending on the display context.\n",
    "* `px`: stands for \"pixel\", but does not necessarily correspond literally to a pixel in CSS; the interpretation is more abstract. The increment `1px` corresponds to an optical reference unit that is the smallest object likely to be visible on a screen. Some but not all displays can render objects that are less than `1px`.\n",
    "* `em`: the height of one line of text, at the current font size, from baseline to baseline.\n",
    "* `%`: percentage of the immediately containing SVG box.\n",
    "* `pt`: a unit inherited from print typography, but again in CSS this is interpreted kind of abstractly and won't really correspond to any reliable physical distance (what you might expect from the history). Not recommended for screen-oriented rendering. For css and svg, `1pt = 0.75px` (so `12pt = 16px`, for the most useful special case)."

As this example illustrates, a path needn't be complete, and for annotation purposes will typically be interpreted as selecting an entire constituent, though for some purposes it may select a node. As a reminder, a length 1 path written as a tuple will require a comma so that python can disambiguate it from just a regular number in parenthesis, e.g. `(0,)`. A path that selects a daughter node whose index is greater than the number of daughters at that point in the tree is invalid. Using negative indices is possible, and these will be interpreted like negative indices in python: e.g. `-1` selects the rightmost node, etc.\n",

No node will be positioned vertically below a node that does not dominate it. There is also a configurable padding parameter. Horizontal spacing is calculated initially in estimated *em*s, but (canvas width aside) is converted to percentages for svg layout.

    "@sec-nodes-constituents provided examples of how to use the built-in node builder functions. The `svgling` package also allows you to define custom node-builder functions, and by doing so, use arbitrary SVG in a tree node, via the `svgwrite` package. A node-builder function should be decorated with `@svgling.core.node_builder` and return a `svgling.core.NodePos` object that has the correct dimensions set (currently, these cannot be inferred from SVG). `NodePos` is a wrapper class for an arbitrary SVG object using the `svgwrite` package. The details of constructing SVG diagrams progamattically go somewhat beyond the scope of this manual, and I won't explain the SVG format or the [svgwrite api](https://svgwrite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) in detail here. But generally, you will want to construct `svgwrite.container.SVG` objects that contain `svgwrite.text.Text` objects, possibly with `svgwrite.text.TSpan` objects within those.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific notes on constructing `NodePos` and the contained svg objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Minimally, the returned `NodePos` should have `width` and `height` set (otherwise, they default to `0`). These can be set as named parameters to the constructor, or via the `set_dimensions` function, which also takes them as named parameters.\n",
    "* It is also recommended to set `text` to something readable, so that the object can be inspected without svg rendering.\n",
    "* `x` and `y` can be used to shift position relative to the tree; `x=50` centers (and is probably what you want in most cases).\n",
    "* User coordinates can be assumed to match `px`, and for text rendering, unless you explicitly set font size, you should use the provided `options` value to get font sizing via `em` (provides a string with units) and `em_to_px` (provides a number in user coordinates).\n",
    "* The `options` parameter will be filled in when building a tree, but you should allow for direct calls for debugging.\n",
    "* The position of 0,0 is relative to a container constructed on top of NodePos. You can assume that it will have the width specified by NodePos, with height specified by NodePos with some extra y space; the below example demonstrates this.\n",
    "* Tips: use debug mode. Draw reference points when testing (e.g. `svgwrite.shapes.Circle((0,0), r=3, fill=options.text_color)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following cell provides a small example of implementing a node builder. As you can see, the svg standard is the limit in what you can draw here, but dealing with positioning is overall not entirely trivial.

    "\n",
    "This package provides limited support for tree diagrams that mix HTML/CSS and SVG, using the former for layout and the latter for line drawing, via the `svgling.html` module. These have a number of limitations relative to pure SVG diagrams, with two main advantages: (i) the nodes can consist of arbitrary HTML/CSS, including mathjax, `xml.etree.ElementTree` objects, and more and (ii) sizing of the overall tree diagrams is fully automatic based on leaf node sizes. The limitations are detailed below, but the main one to know about is that these trees do not support branching greater than binary. As with the rest of this package, the hybrid layout techniques are single-pass and make do without any javascript. The rendering techniques require up-to-date and recent browsers. At the moment, these trees are less intended for direct instantiation and more intended for programmatic use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module interface is similar, with `svgling.html.draw_tree` as the main interface function, and `svgling.html.DivTreeLayout` as the main class parallel to `svgling.core.TreeLayout`, and `svgling.core.TreeOptions` used to configure the tree (though see below for supported parameters). After the following examples, I will give a precise list of the limitations relative to SVG diagrams and the supported options."
